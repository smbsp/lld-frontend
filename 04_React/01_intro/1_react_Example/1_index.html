<!--  
 1. component: Components are independent and reusable bits of code. 
 They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, 
 but work in isolation and return HTML
 2. Prop : properties passed to a component
 3. JSX -> Javascript and XML
 4. you create bigger components using smaller component
-->

<!-- JSX is transpiled to plain JavaScript by tools like Babel before it is executed in the browser. The transpiled version of the JSX 
in the return statement would look something like this in plain JavaScript:

return React.createElement(
  "h1",
  null,
  "Hello My name: ",
  name,
  ", and my age: ",
  age,
  " and working as ",
  occupation
); -->
