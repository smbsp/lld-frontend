Previously we discussed that inline styling is not a recommended practice,
but in terms of specificity we say that In-styling is given more priority so when should we use In-line styling ???
I mean can you give an example of where we can use it ??


1. Not easy to maintain code.
2. HTML elements are keep repeating and we suppose to reuse that element. This will not possible in inline styling.
3. Learning specificity is very important.
