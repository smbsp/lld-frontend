Performance Metrics
There are a few things that can't be visually observed in a webpage but are important. They are:

1. Performance: How fast is the website load time and how quick are the interactions
2. Accessibility: Features that make a website usable (like assistive devices, it's easy for people with disabilities to use as well)
3. Best Practice in Coding: Readability, a good naming convention, Code Quality, Code Coverage (How much lines of code actually contribute to the actual website, there should be no code present that is not being used in the website)
4. SEO: Search Engine Optimization
