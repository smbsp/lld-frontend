Some key concepts related to JavaScript execution and rendering in the browser. Let me explain each of them in more detail:

0. **Call Stack:** The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of function calls in a JavaScript program. It 
 follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. When a function is called, it's pushed onto the call stack, 
 and when it returns or completes, it's popped off the stack. This stack determines the order in which synchronous 
 code is executed.

For asynchronous code, when the call stack is empty, the event loop checks the tasks queue for pending tasks 
and executes them.

1. **Tasks Queue:** The tasks queue, often referred to as the "task queue" or "callback queue," is a part of the event loop
  in JavaScript. It's responsible for managing asynchronous code execution. When asynchronous events like I/O operations, 
  timers (e.g., `setTimeout`), or event listeners (e.g., click events) have their callback functions ready to run, those 
  callbacks are placed in the tasks queue.

The event loop continuously checks if the call stack is empty. If it is, it takes the next task from the tasks queue 
and pushes it onto the call stack for execution.

2. **Microtasks Queue:** The microtasks queue is a separate queue that handles microtasks, which have a higher priority 
 than tasks. Promises and certain other asynchronous operations, like `process.nextTick` in Node.js or 
 `MutationObserver` in the browser, schedule callbacks to run as microtasks. Microtasks are executed before the next 
 rendering, and they are processed entirely before tasks.

This means that if there are microtasks in the microtasks queue, they will be executed before any tasks in the 
tasks queue.

3. **UI Rendering:** The browser's rendering engine is responsible for rendering web pages. The rendering process 
 involves various steps, including layout, paint, and composite. The browser tries to render at a consistent 
 frame rate, typically 60 frames per second (FPS) for smooth animations.
