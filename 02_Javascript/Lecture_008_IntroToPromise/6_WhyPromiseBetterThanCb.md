Why Promises Are Better than Callback
    1. Promises can be either resolved or rejected once in the lifetime. (So we can trust other code).
    2. Callback of promise go to a seperate queue known as microtask queue it has higher priority then the normal callback queue.
    3. we can avoid pyramid of dom structure easily.
    4. code is cleaner and easy to read/maintain.



Promise is a logic so it is a part of js(language).
