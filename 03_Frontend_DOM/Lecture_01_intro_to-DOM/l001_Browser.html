     * Question: What do you understand by browser?
     *
     * Answer -> It is Software application that helps us to access information on the internet and present in into 
     * humanunderstand formate.
     * 
     * Question: What are the different components/features that makes up a broswer.
     * 
     * Answer:
     * 1. Cookies, Local storage, session storage, address bar, button, tabs(User Interface)
     * 2. JS Engine
     * 3. Rendering Engine (Converts code into UI)
     * 4. Networking(I have the capability to interact with outer world)
     * 5. Browser Security Model
     * 6. Dev Tools 
     * 7. History
     * 8. Bookmark
     * 
     * Question: How browser allows to access these features developer -> developing a UI app ??
     * Answer: 
     * 1. WEB API: is the interface to access all the component or the features.
     * 2. API(Application Programming Interface): API is an object that represent a feature and developer 
     *    can interact with API using it's exposed prop and methods.
     * 3. You can Use JS to interact with all these API.
     * 4. WEB APIs: console, DOM API, web storage API, Fetch API wtc., 
     *   
     * 
     * 
     * First Principle is: To implement any feature -> You have to use an API given by Browser and that API 
     * is always an object -> method and props and we will use JS to do it.
