### Drag and Drop
1. The `draggable="true"` attribute is added to each  element to make them draggable.
2. The `dragstart` event is triggered when the user starts dragging a task. It is only called once 
3.  The `dragover` event is used to indicate that a draggable element is being dragged over a valid drop target. It is called continuously.
4. The `drop` event is triggered when the user drops a draggable element onto a drop target. 
5. The `dragend` event is triggered when the drag operation ends. it is when the whole iteration is finished
