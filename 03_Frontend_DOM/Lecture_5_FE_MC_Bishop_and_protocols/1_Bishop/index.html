     Problem: bishop moves in chess board.

      Must have feature: 
        1. By default 8 X 8 chess board.
        2. White and black cell which is clearly visible.
        3. Over hovering it should show all possible moves of the player.
        4. Highligh moves in yellow color.

    Good to have feature:
        1. I let user to create N X N board.
        2. I let user to select emojies for player.
        3. I will allow user to pick multiple players to check its moves.

    Approach:
       1. HTML/CSS
          a. Build static HTML/CSS.

        2. Javascript.
          a. Figure out(store somewhere) all possibe moves of current player from current cell.
