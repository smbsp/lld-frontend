# Low-Level Design of Frontend Systems

Welcome to the Low-Level Design of Frontend Systems repository! This comprehensive repository is dedicated to learning and implementing the low-level design of front-end systems using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and React. Each component and project in this repository aims to enhance your understanding of front-end development from the basics to advanced concepts.

## Introduction

This repository is designed to provide a structured approach to learning the low-level design principles of front-end systems. It covers the fundamental technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as advanced topics like DOM manipulation and React. Each section contains detailed explanations, code examples, and practical projects to reinforce the concepts learned.

## Setup and Installation

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/smbsp/lld-frontend.git
    cd lld-frontend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed, then run:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the development server**:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

## Components

### HTML Basics

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. It provides the structure of a webpage, using a variety of elements to define different types of content.

- **Basic Structure**: Understanding the basic structure of an HTML document, including elements like `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, `<title>`, etc.
- **Common Tags**: Learning about common HTML tags such as `<div>`, `<span>`, `<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<p>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, `<table>`, etc.
- **Forms and Inputs**: Creating forms using `<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<button>`, and understanding form attributes.

### CSS Styling

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages. It controls the color, font, spacing, and positioning of HTML elements.

- **Selectors and Properties**: Learning about different CSS selectors (class, ID, element) and properties (color, font-size, margin, padding, border, etc.).
- **Box Model**: Understanding the CSS box model, including content, padding, border, and margin.
- **Flexbox and Grid**: Using CSS Flexbox and Grid for advanced layout designs.
- **Responsive Design**: Creating responsive web pages using media queries.

### JavaScript Fundamentals

JavaScript is a versatile programming language that adds interactivity to web pages. It is essential for front-end development.

- **Syntax and Variables**: Understanding JavaScript syntax, variables (`var`, `let`, `const`), and data types (string, number, boolean, array, object).
- **Functions and Control Flow**: Learning about functions, conditionals (`if`, `else`, `switch`), loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).
- **Events and Event Handling**: Handling user events like clicks, form submissions, and keyboard inputs.
- **ES6 Features**: Exploring ES6 features such as arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, and modules.

### DOM Manipulation

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.

- **Selecting Elements**: Using methods like `getElementById`, `getElementsByClassName`, `querySelector`, and `querySelectorAll`.
- **Modifying Elements**: Changing the content, style, and attributes of HTML elements using JavaScript.
- **Event Listeners**: Adding and removing event listeners to handle user interactions.
- **Traversing the DOM**: Navigating through the DOM tree to access and manipulate elements.

### React Components

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.

- **Component Basics**: Understanding React components, props, and state.
- **JSX Syntax**: Writing components using JSX syntax.
- **Lifecycle Methods**: Exploring React component lifecycle methods.
- **Hooks**: Using React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and custom hooks.
- **State Management**: Managing state in React applications with Context API and Redux.

## Projects

This section contains various projects to apply the concepts learned in each component. Each project is designed to reinforce your understanding and provide hands-on experience.

1. **Simple HTML Page**: Creating a basic HTML page with various elements.
2. **CSS Styling Project**: Designing a responsive webpage using CSS Flexbox and Grid.
3. **JavaScript Calculator**: Building a simple calculator application with JavaScript.
4. **DOM Manipulation Game**: Developing a Kanban Board.
5. **React Todo App**: Creating front-end for an eCommerce application.
